# firas

The main code file is `firas.py`.

The `tex` directory contains a note with a short description of the problem and
the results obtained.

The `results` directory contains some plots of the observed spectrum along with
the Planck blackbody spectrum for different temperatures. There is also a plot
of the chi-square deviance as a function of the temperature.
